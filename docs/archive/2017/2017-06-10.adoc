Lorenzo has been part of the Neo4j community since 2013. He started with mapping out https://inserpio.wordpress.com/?s=gogh[Vincent van Gogh’s journey] using Spring Data Neo4j and Neo4j-Spatial which led to the http://www.neo4art.org/about.html[Neo4Art initiative]. Lorenzo prefers graph databases over other NoSQL databases because of the flexible and expressive connected data model. 

To make it easier to integrate other databases with Neo4j he and his team worked on connectors for RDBMS, http://www.larus-ba.it/neo4j/en/tag/doc2graph/[Couchbase, and MongoDB]. They also developed and are maintaining http://www.larus-ba.it/neo4j/en/tag/jdbc/[Neo4j’s JDBC driver] which allows you to use existing ETL and BI Tools with our graph database. In the recent months the Larus team has been supporting https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/projects/1[APOC development] and improving the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-etl-components/projects/1[neo4j-etl-components].

Lorenzo's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0teVUF9NCdU[spoken^] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkXq66zSXPk[multiple times^] at GraphConnect conferences and he has team at LARUS are very active members in the community.

Thanks you Lorenzo and team for all your work on behalf of the Neo4j community!

=== Visualizing crime patterns data as a graph

Christian Miles wrote an article showing how to combine Neo4j and Keylines to https://cambridge-intelligence.com/visualizing-crime-patterns-data-graph[visualize crime patterns data as a graph^].

In the post Christian imports data from the https://data.boston.gov/group/public-safety[data.boston.gov^] initiative into Neo4j using https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/#_load_json[APOC's Load JSON procedure^], before analysing it by district and crime category. 

He goes on to add generated people, phone, and vehicle data to the graph to simulate the type of investigation a police officer might undertake.

=== Game of Thrones, Fighting Financial Crime, H2O

* Swapnil Kumar has built a https://medium.com/@swapnil31kgp/graph-of-thrones-3cbddf0eec74[Game of Thrones graph^] in preparation for Season 7 which should be released in the next month or so. 

* The https://twitter.com/NfqAdvisory[NfqAdvisory^] team wrote up their experience of a http://nfq.es/en/blog/graph-databases-and-fraud-detection/[Graph Databases applied to Fraud Detection^] event in Spain. 

* https://twitter.com/intercax[Intercax^] released version 3.1 of http://intercax.com/products/syndeia[Syndeia^] - a software platform for integrated model-based engineering - which now allows users to generate graphs from SysML models or/and its interconnections to model elements in other enterprise repositories. Users can then execute Cypher queries on these graphs to make sense of the data.

* Giovanni T. Parra put the code for https://boardthreads.com/[boardthreads.com^] - a service that used Mailgun and Neo4j to turn a Trello board/list into a helpdesk - https://github.com/fiatjaf/boardthreads[on GitHub^] after deciding to shut it down.

* https://twitter.com/elise_deux[Elise Devaux^], Marketing Project Manager at https://twitter.com/Linkurious[Linkurious^], explains how graphs can be used to http://www.analyticbridge.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/fighting-financial-crimes-and-money-laundering-with-graph-data?xg_source=activity[fight financial crimes and money laundering^]. Elise shows how you can setup a fraud watch-list to keep you informed when money laundering patterns occur and then use Linkurious' graph visualization interface to investigate and assess the different cases.

* http://www.graphadvantage.com/author/michael-moore/[Michael Moore^] created https://github.com/graphadvantage/neo4j-h2o-template[neo4j-h2o-template^], which contains a set of iPython notebooks that show how to combine Neo4j with https://www.h2o.ai/[H2O.ai^] - the open source machine learning platform.

=== From The Knowledge Base

This week from the https://neo4j.com/developer/kb[Neo4j Knowledge Base^] we have a couple of https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/post-union-processing/[workarounds for the lack of post UNION processing in Cypher^].

=== openCypher: Transactions and Analytics with Neo4j and Cypher for Spark 

We're releasing roughly one video a day from http://graphconnect.com/gc2017-europe/[GraphConnect Europe 2017^], and this week saw the release of the openCypher talk given by Alastair Green, https://twitter.com/boggle[Stefan Plantikow^], and https://twitter.com/aethelraed[Petra Selmer^].

++++

In the talk they cover using Cypher for OLTP workloads on Neo4j and OLAP workloads on Spark. They also propose a syntax for multi graph queries and the ability to return graphs from Cypher.

=== Next Week

What’s happening next week in the world of graph databases?

* On Tuesday June 13th, 2017 Rik Van Bruggen will be showing how to https://www.meetup.com/graphdb-belgium/events/240368721/[explore corporate networks in Neo4j^] at the https://www.meetup.com/graphdb-belgium/[Neo4j Belgium meetup^].

* On Thursday June 15th, 2017 https://twitter.com/metadaddy[Pat Patterson^] will be joining the https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/[Neo4j Online Meetup^] to talk about https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/events/240413114/[visualizing and analyzing Salesforce data with Neo4j^]. 

* Also on Thursday June 15th, 2017 Preston Hendrickson will show how to https://www.meetup.com/graphdb-baltimore/events/239370768/[implement some of the new enterprise security features^] at the Graph Database Baltimore meetup. 

=== Tweet of the Week

My favourite tweet this week was by the https://twitter.com/sinarproject[Sinar Project^] - an initiative using open source technology, development and ideas to make Malaysian government transparent and accountable.
