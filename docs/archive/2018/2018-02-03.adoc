This Week in Neo4j – 3 June 2017

////

Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days. 

This week we have a graph of Thomson Reuters’ OpenPermID dataset, running Neo4j on Google Cloud, migrating from MySQL to Neo4, as well as a data lineage talk from GraphConnect NYC 2017.

Suellen was also https://soundcloud.com/leadinglines/episode-006-suellen-stringer-hye-and-micheal-hunger[interviewed on the Leading Lines podcast^] alongside my colleague https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael Hunger^] in 2016.

On behalf of the Neo4j and humanities communities, thanks for all your work Suellen!

=== Pick of the week: Thomson Reuters’ OpenPermID Graph

In the latest installation of his https://jesusbarrasa.wordpress.com/tag/rdf/[Neo4j is your RDF store^] series https://twitter.com/barrasadv[Jesús Barrasa^] https://jesusbarrasa.wordpress.com/2018/02/01/neo4j-is-your-rdf-store-part-3-thomson-reuters-openpermid/[shows how to build a graph^] of https://permid.org/[Thomson Reuters OpenPermId dataset^].

Thomson Reuters’ OpenPermID
</strong>
</p>
++++

In the first part of the post Jesus shows how to import the dataset using the https://github.com/jbarrasa/neosemantics[neosemantics^] extension. The dataset contains 127 million triples which is turned into a graph of 18.8 million nodes and 101 million relationships. 

Jesus then goes on to show how to query the graph to do complex path analysis and how to build nice charts on the output of those queries using standard BI tools. He finishes the post by showing how to build an RDF API on top of the graph.

You can get all the code from Jesus' blog post from the https://github.com/jbarrasa/openpermid2neo4j[openpermid2neo4j^] GitHub repository.

=== From GraphConnect: Real-Time Data Lineage at UBS

At GraphConnect NYC 2017 Wren Chan and Sidharth Goyal explained how Neo4j allows them to trace lineage of all metrics for all initiatives across the bank.

In the talk they explain how they built a system that syncs data between Oracle and Neo4j and does lineage generation using Cypher queries. A fun dataset of the UK royal family is used to explain how it all works.

=== Kubernetes on Google Cloud, Django, Excel
