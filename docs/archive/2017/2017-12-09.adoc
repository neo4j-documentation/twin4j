On behalf of the Neo4j community thanks for all your work Mike!

=== ICIJ release Paradise Papers version of Neo4j Database

Late last week The ICIJ released an https://neo4j.com/blog/icij-releases-neo4j-desktop-download-paradise-papers[ICIJ version of Neo4j Desktop^] which includes the Paradise Papers and the other Offshore Leaks graph data.

On the back of that my colleague https://twitter.com/gerritmeier[Gerrit Meier^] has created https://github.com/meistermeier/sdn-paradise[sdn-paradise^] - a Spring Data Neo4j project that allows you to analyse the https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/paradise-papers[Paradise Papers^]. 

=== Graph Powered Search with Elastic and Neo4j

https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael Hunger^], https://twitter.com/ikwattro[Christophe Willemsen^], and https://twitter.com/AlessandroNegro[Alessandro Negro^] have created a https://dzone.com/refcardz/graph-powered-search-neo4j-amp-elasticsearch[DZone Graph Powered Search Refcard ^].

</strong>
</p>

It includes code and examples for using Elasticsearch to enable full-text search and Neo4j to power graph-aided search. 

=== Fraudsters, Terrorists, Knowledge Graphs, Jim Webber Interview

* https://twitter.com/geoHeil[Georg Heiler^] https://medium.com/@georg.kf.heiler/graph-171dbd5b8de8[shows how to identify hidden fraudsters and terrorists using Neo4j^] by looking at their distance from known people. Georg's code is also available as a https://github.com/geoHeil/graph-playground/blob/master/neo4j.ipynb[Jupyter notebook^].

* Rolf Håvard Blindheim's https://github.com/inonit/django-chemtrails[django-chemtrails] uses Neo4j to help determine if a user has permissions to perform some action on an object, based on the relationship between entities.

* Chun Li has created https://github.com/jasonlin94/FindMyCar[FindMyCar^], a Flask application on top of a used cars knowledge graph. Chun also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go-xj6v12EE&feature=youtu.be[posted a video^] that explains how to use the system and shows the Cypher queries behind the application.

* Silicon Angle have an interview with my colleague https://twitter.com/jimwebber[Dr Jim Webber^] and Comcast's Director of Engineering for IoT, Mark Hashimoto - https://siliconangle.com/blog/2017/12/02/graph-databases-hot-can-break-relationals-grip/[Graph databases are hot, but can they break relational’s grip?^]. They talk about the use cases for which graphs are a good fit and the performance improvements they give over relational databases for certain workloads.

=== Cyber threat intelligence

We've previously covered the https://neo4j.com/blog/this-week-neo4j-29-july-2017/[use of Neo4j for security and threat detection^] and this week I came across a tool in that ecosystem called https://github.com/workingDog/StixToNeoDB[StixToNeoDB^].

<strong>
STIX - Sharing threat intelligence just got a lot easier
</strong>
</p>
++++

Structured Threat Information Expression (https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/[STIX^]) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence.

StixToNeoDB loads STIX objects and relations from JSON and zip files into Neo4j.
