Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days. 

=== Featured Community Member: Markus Harrer

This week’s featured community member is https://twitter.com/feststelltaste[Markus Harrer^], Software Development Analyst at Sparda Bank DV.

Markus joined the Neo4j community when he realized the power of the graph for software analytics. In his quest to make software development decisions data driven, he utilized Neo4j to visualize, infer, chart, and analyse the graphs of software.

Markus presented at our online meetup and at several Java User Groups. He also wrote a large number of blog posts with detailed examples of his approach.

Thank you so much Markus!

=== Online Meetup: Software Analytics with Jupyter, Pandas, jQAssistant, and Neo4j

In this week's online meetup Markus Harrer explored my favorite area of graph applications - software analytics. Equipped with the urge to improve software development decisions with data, he uses Jupyter Notebooks with Pandas and Py2Neo to query and visualize data from software project structures, commits and source code.

Based on http://jqassistant.org/get-started[jQAssistants^] capabilities for scanning and analyzing large software projects he uses the graph data to gain specific insights.

Explore his very http://www.feststelltaste.de/[insightful blog^] and the https://www.slideshare.net/feststelltaste/software-analytics-with-jupyter-pandas-jqassistant-and-neo4j-neo4j-online-meetup[slides for the meetup^].

=== Paradise Papers
The Paradise Papers spurred a number of activities this week.

Ryan updated the http://neo4jsandbox.com[Neo4j ICIJ Sandbox^] with the new data and also https://towardsdatascience.com/engineering-awareness-paradise-papers-6303d93cee64[published a Docker image^]:
`docker run -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 ryguyrg/neo4j-paradise-papers`

Will and I wrote a https://neo4j.com/blog/depth-graph-analysis-paradise-papers/[blog post that goes deeper into the graph analytics of the Paradise Papers^], exploring graph algorithms and map visualizations.

Will also shows how to use https://github.com/johnymontana/pp-viz/blob/master/jupyter/PP_Viz.ipynb[Pandas with Neo4j's Python driver^] to quickly analyze graph data.

Rik interviewed http://twitter.com/@niekbartho[Niek Bartholomaeus^] about his http://openthebox.be project, http://blog.bruggen.com/2017/11/podcast-interview-with-niek.html[Belgium's local investigative platform for corporate ownership^]
