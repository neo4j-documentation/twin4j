Laura organises the https://www.meetup.com/Columbia-GraphDB-MeetUp/[Columbia GraphDB^] meetup and has also presented on Neo4j at the https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-MD/events/240982895/[Data Science meetup^] in Maryland

Laura presented https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5PBXX1CZQs[Sentiment and Social Network Analysis^] at our most recent GraphConnect conference in New York City. In this talk Laura showed how https://socialbee.io/[SocialBee^] enriches social network analysis with topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and trending over time.

A few days after returning home from the conference Laura had her first baby!

On behalf of the Neo4j community, congratulations and thanks for all your work Laura!

Daniel also presented https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwhAlNgjvMA[lightning talk^] on the same topic at GraphConnect SF 2016. He also wrote an https://neo4j.com/blog/integrating-biology-public-neo4j-database/[accompanying blog post^].

=== Geocoding Paradise Papers, Graphs for Telecoms, Graph Algorithms

* In http://www.lyonwj.com/2017/11/28/geocoding-paradise-papers-neo4j-spatial-visualization/[Geocoding Paradise Papers Addresses In Neo4j To Build Interactive Geographical Data Visualizations^] my colleague https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] shows how to retrieve detailed address information from Google's geocoding API using an APOC procedure. He then builds several visualizations using http://leafletjs.com/[Leaflet.js^]. 

* In https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz[Tomaz Bratanic^]'s latest blog post he shows how to https://tbgraph.wordpress.com/2017/11/27/neo4j-graph-algorithms-projecting-a-virtual-graph/[run graph algorithms over a projected movie graph^]. 

* https://twitter.com/prgarnett[Dr Philip Garnett^] has written a https://www.prgarnett.net/daniel-morgan-murder/[really interesting blog post^] where he builds a graph containing people, companies, and organisations related to the http://www.untoldmurder.com/book-1/[murder of Daniel Morgan^]. Philip also runs the http://algorithmicindexing.net/[Algorithmic Indexing^] research project, which aims to integrate open source text processing tools to assist with the analysis, navigation, and reading of large document based data sets.

* My colleague https://twitter.com/barrasadv[Jesús Barrasa^]  presented a webinar https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPI1Als3Jv8[Graph Solutions for Telecoms^], in which he shows how to use graphs to solve common problems in the telecoms domain such as finding single points of failure, fraud detection, and root cause analysis.

=== Paradise Papers at ada_CONF

My colleague https://github.com/Lojjs[Louise Söderström^] explained how we build the Cypher query language as well as covering common graph use cases in a talk at https://twitter.com/ada_conf[ada_CONF^].
