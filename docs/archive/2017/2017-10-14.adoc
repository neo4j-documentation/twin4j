https://twitter.com/structr[Structr^] is a graph-based low-code development and runtime environment for building data-centric web and mobile Applications and uses Neo4j as its backend datastore.

I did a bit of searching on the Structr GitHub repository and found out that Axel has been working with Neo4j since https://github.com/structr/structr/commit/3615595f8c4935ef8a904f3a74abaf6f73902ace#diff-645b09775593053754cd8e50f2e1140fR23[at least version 1.6^] back in early 2012.

Axel presented at https://vimeo.com/76818240[GraphConnect SF 2013^], https://vimeo.com/80480434[GraphConnect London 2013^], https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahe8rcyAdbI[GraphConnect EU 2015^], https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS4EzYFoxAo[GraphConnect EU 2016^], http://blog.bruggen.com/2015/09/podcast-interview-with-axel-morgner.html[featured on the podcast a couple of years ago^], and has written 
https://neo4j.com/blog/contributor/axel-morgner/[several articles for the Neo4j blog^].

Structr are sponsors of http://graphconnect.com/[GraphConnect New York 2017^] so you'll be able to meet Axel and the team on October 24th at Pier 36, NYC. 

On behalf of the Neo4j community thanks for all your work Axel!

=== SDN 5.0 release

For over half a year the SDN/OGM team has been working on new features in https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-ogm/[Neo4j Object Graph Mapping library (OGM)^] and https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-neo4j/[Spring Data Neo4j (SDN)] framework. 

We are happy to announce the release of OGM 3.0 and SDN 5.0 earlier this week and a detailed blog post coming next week. 

If you used either library before, make sure to check out our migration guides (http://neo4j.com/docs/ogm-manual/3.0/migration/[OGM^], https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/5.0.0.RELEASE/reference/html/#migration.5-0[SDN^])

We're also welcoming http://twitter.com/meistermeier[Gerrit Meier^] to the Spring Data Neo4j team within Neo4j engineering.

If you are attending http://graphconnect.com[GraphConnect, NYC Oct 23-24^] you can take the "Building Microservices with Spring" training by Kenny Bastani which will have a section on Spring Data Neo4j 5.0. And make sure to attend the "Spring Data Neo4j 5.0" talk by Nicolas and Gerrit. Also find Nicolas, Gerrit and Michael at GraphConnect for questions and discussions.

=== From GraphConnect: Real-Time Recommender Systems Made Easy with Neo4j 

We didn’t have an online meetup this week so we'll flash back to one of the most popular talks from GraphConnect Europe 2017 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vlWlr58SgI[Real-Time Recommender Systems Made Easy with Neo4j^]  - presented by my colleague https://twitter.com/cailliaup[Pieter Cailliau^]. 

youtube::4vlWlr58SgI[type={type}]

Pieter talks through his experiences helping Neo4j customers build recommendation engines and shows a library he built to simplify the process.

The online meetup is back this week. Norbert Priening will show us how to https://www.meetup.com/preview/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/events/243206424[analyse Debian packages with Neo4j^] at the earlier time of 14.00 BST. You can always watch the video afterwards if that's too early for you!

=== Ethereum, RDF to Neo4j, Network Automation, BloodHound release

* Sander created https://github.com/sardinois/eth_graph[eth_graph], a project which syncs the Ethereum blockchain to Neo4j. It's still in its infancy but looks like a cool one to keep an eye on.

* https://twitter.com/ThomasVanderWal[Thomas Vander Wal^] wrote up his initial experiences learning about graph databases after coming across them in http://thomasvanderwal.blogspot.co.uk/2017/10/blog-iiii-its-rdbms-its-nosql-its-graph.html[a networks module^] at university.

* In https://medium.com/@schubert.inf/how-neo4j-could-help-fighting-crime-3a26abdc3c29[how Neo4j could help fighting crime^] Stefan Schubert compares and contrasts relational and graph models, before going on to show how you might model a crime network in Neo4j.

* https://github.com/yantisj/netgrph[Netgrph^] is a project created by Jonathan Yantis that models IP networks in Neo4j for network automation and troubleshooting. Once you've loaded your data you can run queries to find paths between devices or find all the devices of a particular type across a network. 

* https://github.com/matheusteixeira[Matheus Teixeira^] created https://github.com/matheusteixeira/rdf2multimodel[rdf2multimodel^], a tool that imports RDF triples into Neo4j. The project also has a SPARQL to Cypher adapter.

* https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound[BloodHound^] https://posts.specterops.io/bloodhound-1-4-the-object-properties-update-9932c5b1f3ca[ version 1.4^] was released. BloodHound is a tool that uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment. This release contains ShortestPath bug fixes and added a feature that allows you to collect properties of objects.

=== On StackOverflow: Common ancestors, nested union, logging

This week on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/neo4j[Neo4j StackOverflow^]…​

* https://stackoverflow.com/users/1190376/antimony[Antimony^] writes a query to find a https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46627258/neo4j-get-middle-node-in-path[common ancestor^] between words in a Wordnet graph.

*  https://stackoverflow.com/users/6893866/tezra[Tezra^] shows several ways to write https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46650175/nested-unions-in-cypher-neo4j[a nested union query^] against a http://www.biopax.org/[BioPAX graph^]. COLLECT, UNION, and path filtering all feature.

* https://twitter.com/cleishm[Chris Leishman^] explains https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46650975/neo4j-3-logging-customization[how logging works in Neo4j^] and options for configuring it.
