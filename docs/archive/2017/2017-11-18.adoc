Nicolas has been part of the Neo4j community for the past 4-5 years and started his graph journey analysing till receipts in Neo4j. He later https://vimeo.com/100721646[presented this project^] at the Neo4j meetup in Lille.

Nicolas http://blog.bruggen.com/2017/11/podcast-interview-with-nicolas.html[goes into more detail^] about the project in his interview on https://twitter.com/rvanbruggen[Rik Van Bruggen^]'s https://soundcloud.com/graphistania[Graphistania^] podcast  that was released this week.

Nicolas joined GraphAware in February 2017 and is a core developer on the Spring Data Neo4j and Neo4j OGM products.  He also consults for clients on Neo4j projects.

Nicolas is also co-authoring https://www.d-booker.fr/146-neo4j-2[Neo4j : II. Déploiement^], a French language book that shows how to build a Neo4j backed applications from scratch all the way to production and beyond.

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Nicolas!

=== Online Meetup: Spring Data Neo4j 5/ OGM3

In this week's online meetup Nicolas, https://twitter.com/frant_hartm[Frantisek Hartman^], and https://twitter.com/meistermeier[Gerrit Meier^] presented the recently released Spring Data Neo4j 5.0 and showed off some of its new cool features.

You can read more about the project in the https://neo4j.com/blog/spring-data-neo4j-5-0-release/[release blog post^].

=== Russian Twitter Trolls

https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] has been busy this week applying Natural Language Processing techniques to analyse the tweets of Russian Trolls.

In the first part of http://www.lyonwj.com/2017/11/12/scraping-russian-twitter-trolls-python-neo4j/[Scraping Russian Twitter Trolls With Python, Neo4j, and GraphQL^] Will shows how to retrieve the tweets of 2752 Twitter accounts tied to Russia’s Internet Research Agency that were involved in spreading fake news.

He then imports the data into Neo4j, writes queries to find out what they were tweeting about, before putting a GraphQL API on top of the dataset.

In http://www.lyonwj.com/2017/11/15/entity-extraction-russian-troll-tweets-neo4j/[Applying NLP and Entity Extraction To The Russian Twitter Troll Tweets In Neo4j^] Will uses the https://github.com/aboSamoor/polyglot[Polyglot^] library to apply Named Entity Extraction algorithm to the tweets and discovers that the trolls are mostly tweeting about Trump and Clinton.

=== More NLP, Relato Business Graph, GRANDstack

* https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael Hunger^] wrote https://medium.com/@mesirii/quick-import-relato-business-graph-database-from-data-world-into-neo4j-1b9f16404951[a blog post^] in which he shows how to import https://twitter.com/rjurney[Russel Jurney^]'s https://blog.datasyndrome.com/open-sourcing-relatos-business-graph-database-fca220daadd8[Relato Business Graph^] into Neo4j. Russel's graph contains companies and the links between them: partnerships, customers, competitors, and investors. After importing the data Michael shows how to use Neo4j graph algorithms to find the most influential companies in terms of PageRank and betweenness centrality.

* https://twitter.com/mdavidallen[David Allen^] wrote  https://medium.com/@david.allen_3172/using-nlp-in-neo4j-ac40bc92196f[Neo4j: Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Cypher^], in which he shows how to use https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-nlp[GraphAware's NLP library^] to enrich a Twitter graph and help analyse Donald Trump's twitter stream.  

* And if that's not enough NLP for you Máté Thurzó wrote https://medium.com/@7307236/nlp-with-graphs-on-wedeploy-8be8b5c35b6f[NLP with graphs on WeDeploy^], in which he shows how to build a cloud based natural language processing framework using Neo4j and Spring Boot.

* The video from Will Lyon's talk at ReactNYC - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz5HMIVgWK0[All about GRAND Stack: GraphQL, React, Apollo, and Neo4j^] - is now available. We've recently updated the https://neo4j.com/developer/graphql/[GraphQL developer pages^] so if you want to learn more that's a good place to start.

* I've been watching some of the videos from GraphConnect NYC 2017 and was happy to see that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRpmIeJjx-Y[Ajinkya Kale's talk on eBay ShopBot^] has been released. In this talk Ajinkya discusses their use of Neo4j as a backend to the AI technology in eBay's virtual shopping assistant.
