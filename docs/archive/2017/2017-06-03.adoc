Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days. 

=== Featured Community Member: Niklas Saers

This week's featured community member is https://twitter.com/niklassaers?lang=en[Niklas Saers^], iOS Lead at Unwire and the co-maintainer of https://github.com/graphstory/neo4j-ios[Theo - the Neo4j Swift driver^] with Cory Wiles.

Niklas first came across Neo4j in a workshop hosted by Dr Jim Webber and Ian Robinson back in 2011 and had used it for several prototypes before getting involved with the port of Theo to https://swift.org/blog/swift-3-0-released/[Swift 3.0^] in December 2016.

At that point Theo still used Neo4j's HTTP API so Niklas got to work porting it to use the Bolt protocol. 
In the process he built https://github.com/niklassaers/Bolt-swift[Bolt-swift^], as well as https://github.com/niklassaers/PackStream-Swift[Packstream-Swift^]. 

Next up for Niklas is integrating Theo with https://github.com/vapor/fluent[Fluent^], an ORM for the Server Side Swift framework Vapor.

On behalf of the Neo4j and Swift communities, thanks for all your hard work Niklas!

=== WikiMap: Analysing Wikipedia in Neo4j

https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-shrimali/[Raj Shrimali^] has written a series of articles around importing Wikipedia into Neo4j. 

* https://medium.com/@scarca/wikimap-genesis-74e2a36d91d8[Genesis^] in which Raj explains the import process and loads in a subset of the full dataset.  
* https://medium.com/@scarca/wikimap-pivot-8888c28d1dbc[Pivot^] in which Raj experiments with using different number of threads to import the data.
* https://medium.com/@scarca/wikimap-optimization-7a979541ceb5[Optimization^] where the attempts to speed up the import process continue.
* https://medium.com/@scarca/wikimap-processing-2054a52a4aed[Processing^] where Raj runs a mini retrospective on the import process so far.

The code for Raj's project is available in the https://github.com/scarca/wiki-analysis[wiki-analysis^] repository on GitHub.

=== Neo4j <3 Preact

The https://neo4j.com/release-notes/neo4j-3-2-0/[release of Neo4j 3.2^] at GraphConnect Europe 2017 saw the release of a brand new version of the Neo4j browser.

The browser was completely rewritten using https://twitter.com/preactjs[Preact^], the fast 3kB alternative to the popular https://facebook.github.io/react/[React^] library, and Neo4j are now a proud sponsor of the project. 

On behalf of all users of the Neo4j browser, thank you Preact!

=== Getting started with Neo4j

This was a week where several people wrote about their experiences getting started with graph databases. 

* https://twitter.com/jim_d_hughes[James Hughes^] has just finished applying for the PMP exam and created the http://blog.jimdhughes.com/2017/05/25/my-dive-into-neo4j-and-my-pmp/[Project Management Body of Knowledge graph^]. James then analyzes the dataset using a series of Cypher queries.

* https://twitter.com/dianekierce[Diane Kierce^] is just getting into graph databases and has https://medium.com/@diane.kierce/graph-theory-and-graph-databases-a9c24ed53f65[written about her experience so far^]. 

* Paweł Głowacki has been going through the http://graphdatabases.com/[Graph Databases book^] and https://community.embarcadero.com/blogs/entry/graph-databases-and-neo4j[wrote a brief article^] containing his thoughts so far.

=== Friday is release day

This week saw the release of 4 different versions of Neo4j.

=== Python for IoT, PHP crawler, relational db analysis

* https://twitter.com/CarlTurechek[Carl Turechek^] created https://github.com/siteraiser/Reckless-Recluse[Reckless-Recluse^] - a powerful PHP crawler designed to dig up site problems.

* https://twitter.com/technige[Nigel Small^] created https://github.com/technige/n4[n4^] - a Cypher console for Neo4j. n4 aims to consolidate the old http://py2neo.org/v3/[py2neo^] command line tooling in a new console application which takes inspiration from https://twitter.com/_nicolemargaret[Nicole White^]'s https://github.com/nicolewhite/cycli[cycli^] tool.

* Matt Lewis created https://github.com/m4ttl/thingernet-graph[thingernet-graph^] - a Python script that creates a Neo4j graph showing how a set of Internet of Things (IoT) devices are connected. 

* https://twitter.com/rubinsimons[Rubin Simons^] created https://github.com/rubin55/silver[silver^] - a tool for loading relational/dependency information from relational database systems into Neo4j for analysis and visualization. At the moment it works with Oracle and next up are PostgreSQL, MySQL, and DB2.

=== From The Knowledge Base

This week from the https://neo4j.com/developer/kb[Neo4j Knowledge Base^] we have an article showing how to https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/resetting-query-cardinality/[reset query cardinality in Cypher queries^] to address the 'too much WIP' issue that you can sometimes run into.
