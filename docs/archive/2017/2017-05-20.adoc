If you'd like to take part, https://twitter.com/stubailo[Sashko Stubailo^] has created https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/community-graph-starter-kit[the community graph starter kit^] which provides the skeleton of an application that uses the https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client[Apollo GraphQL client^] to connect to and query the http://graphql.communitygraph.org/[GraphQL community graph^]. 

=== The Salesforce graph, Software analytics, Automated menu planning

* https://twitter.com/metadaddy[Pat Patterson^] wrote a cool post showing how to https://streamsets.com/blog/visualizing-analyzing-salesforce-data-neo4j/[analyse Salesforce data using Neo4j^]. Pat shows how to import data using the JDBC connector and then shows how to write a query to find the biggest outstanding opportunity. 

* https://twitter.com/d_pawlukiewicz[Dariusz Pawlukiewicz^] has been writing a series of posts  on Neo4j and Cypher, and this week shows how to http://foreverframe.net/neo4j-cypher-2-creating-complex-query/[write complex queries^] as well as explaining the http://foreverframe.net/neo4j-cypher-3-union-with-clasuse/[UNION & WITH clauses^]. 


* https://twitter.com/feststelltaste[Markus Harrer^], who featured in https://neo4j.com/tag/twin4j/[#twin4j^] on https://neo4j.com/blog/this-week-neo4j-11-march-2017/[11 March 2017^] and https://neo4j.com/blog/this-week-neo4j-18-march-2017/[18 March 2017^], presented https://www.slideshare.net/feststelltaste/software-analytics-for-pragmatists-devops-camp-2017[Software Analytics for Pragmatists^] at https://devops-camp.de/[DevOps Camp 2017^] in Nürnberg. 

* https://twitter.com/dirkmahler[Dirk Mahler^] has a very detailed post showing how to https://jqassistant.org/shadows-of-the-past-analysis-of-git-repositories/[analyse Git repositories using jQAssistant^] in all sorts of ways. He shows how to write Cypher queries to find experts in domains and technologies, distribution of development activity, potential hotspots in the code, and much more. 

* On the https://techbrunch.gousto.co.uk/[Gousto Tech blog^] https://twitter.com/irenillap[Irene Iriarte^] explains how they've been https://techbrunch.gousto.co.uk/2017/05/18/decyphering-recipes/[combining graph databases and genetic algorithms^] to create an automated menu planning algorithm which produces new recipes for their customers.

* Quackit released a https://www.quackit.com/neo4j/tutorial/[tutorial for learning Neo4j^]. If you've been meaning to give Neo4j a try, this could be your weekend to get started!

=== State of graph databases survey

IBM released the results of their  http://www.zdnet.com/pictures/the-state-of-graph-databases-worldwide/[State of graph databases survey^] where people were asked why they're using graph databases and what they're planning to use them for in future.

=== Democratising data at Airbnb

Following on from their talk at GraphConnect Europe last week, Chris Williams and John Bodley explain how Airbnb have developed Dataportal, a novel data resource search and discovery tool 
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/democratizing-data-at-airbnb-852d76c51770[to make sense of their internal data^]. 

++++
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gayXC2FDSiA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Dataportal combines Flask, ElasticSearch, and Neo4j to help employees discover and then search data that would usually only be available in team specific silos. 

ComputerWorld UK also have a detailed http://www.cio.com/article/3196730/data-management/article.html#tk.rss_all[write up of the talk^].
