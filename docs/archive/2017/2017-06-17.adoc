Jasper is an experienced mobile developer and authored the popular Typhoon DI-framework for iOS.


As part of his http://appsquick.ly/[AppsQuick.ly^] consultancy he started to use Neo4j from Kotlin in the backend of the social network for musicians "Vampr".

Jasper was an early SpringSource consultant, and after joining our partner https://twitter.com/graph_aware[GraphAware^] Jasper contributed a lot to the development of https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-neo4j/[Spring Data Neo4j^] and https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-ogm[Neo4j-OGM^].

He most recently published a comprehensive example for using https://github.com/neo4j-examples/movies-kotlin-spring-data-neo4j-4[Spring Data Neo4j with Spring Boot and Kotlin^] which he plans to extend with Spring Security and Spring Social features.

Jasper is also a regular answerer of questions on the Neo4j tag on StackOverflow, helping out new users as they get started with their graph journey.

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Jasper!

=== OSCON recommendations, Static code analysis, Marvel Social Graph

* https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] posted the video for his https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLYXrHS_RtDZ2fbH6Ml9K5DxYBATYGeCgN&v=wbI5JwIFYEM[popular OSCON recommendation engines tutorial^]. Will starts with a gentle introduction to recommender systems before moving onto a hands on example where the participants build a meetup recommendation engine. 

* Pierre-Alexandre Voye wrote an interesting article - https://greenspector.com/en/articles/2017-06-12-analyse-statique-code-bdd-orientee-graphe/[static analysis of a code in a graph database^] -  which goes through different approaches to analysing code eventually arriving at the 'Call Graph'. https://greenspector.com/en/[Greenspector^], where Pierre-Alexandre works as an R&D Engineer, are now using Neo4j and Cypher as part of their toolkit.

* Yash Sharma shows how to use Neo4j to store the http://yasharmaster.github.io/blog/2017/metadata-in-neo4j/[Intermine meta graph^]. 

* https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz[Tomaž Bratanič^] shows how to build a https://tbgraph.wordpress.com/2017/06/10/neo4j-marvel-social-graph/[Neo4j Marvel Social Graph^] from https://www.kaggle.com/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network[Kaggle competition data^]. The post has a nice example showing how to use https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/#_apoc_periodic_iterate[apoc.periodic.iterate^] to batch the creation of a weighted undirected hero network.

*  In http://www.dataversity.net/state-art-data-modeling/[State of the Art of Data Modeling?^] Thomas Frisendal goes through the data modeling landscape, covering the different meanings assigned to the term, knowledge graphs, and the future of data modeling. 

* ElixirConf 2017 announced their schedule and https://twitter.com/stabbymcduck[Regina Imhoff^] will be presenting https://elixirconf.com/speakers/#regina_imhoff[a talk about Neo4j and Elixir^] where attendees will learn how to combine Elixir Phoenix with Neo4j to make a clone of a popular social networking site with real time updates to the social graph.

* https://twitter.com/szarnyasg[Gabor Szarnyas^] shared the slides from https://www.slideshare.net/neo4j/graphconnect-europe-2017-ingraph-live-queries-on-graphs[ingraph: Live Queries on Graphs^], presented at the Budapest meetup.

* https://twitter.com/niekbartho[Niek Bartholomeus^] shared the slides from https://speakerdeck.com/niekbartho/openthebox[OpenTheBox - A view of Corporate Networks in Belgium^], presented at the Brussels meetup.

* https://twitter.com/monkchips[James Governor^] mentions https://neo4j.com/developer/graphql/[neo4j-graphql^] in the article http://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2017/06/15/what-is-graphql-and-why-should-you-care-the-future-of-apis/[What is GraphQL and why should you care? The future of APIs^]. 

=== Online Meetup: Visualizing and Analyzing Salesforce Data with Neo4j 

In this week's online meetup https://twitter.com/metadaddy[Pat Patterson^], Community Champion at https://streamsets.com/[StreamSets^], showed us how to use https://streamsets.com/products/sdc/[StreamSets Data Collector^] to import Salesforce data into Neo4j.

Pat also has https://streamsets.com/blog/visualizing-analyzing-salesforce-data-neo4j/[a blog post^] on the same subject.

=== On GitHub: Medical knowledge graph, Generating fake data, versioning graphs
 
* https://github.com/kbogas[Bougiatiotis Konstantinos^] created  https://github.com/kbogas/medknow[medknow^] - a library that can be used to create a disease-specific knowledge base by deriving medical relations using entity extraction on biomedical free text. 
 
* https://github.com/rhblind[Rolf Håvard Blindheim^] has released several versions of https://github.com/inonit/django-chemtrails[django-chemtrails^], a project which uses a graph to help determine if a user has permissions to perform some action on an object, based on the relationship between entities. The project is in a pre alpha state but if you're working in this area there might be some useful ideas to take away. 
 
* https://neo4j.com/staff/kees-vegter/[Kees Vegter^] created  https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-faker[neo4j-faker^], a tool for generating fake demo or test data via Cypher functions. 
 
* Marco Falcier created  https://github.com/h-omer/neo4j-versioner-core[neo4j-versioner-core^], a collection of procedures to manage the entity-state model - a way of modeling multiple versions of data in a graph.

=== On the Podcast: Sébastien Heymann

On the Graphistania podcast this week we have http://blog.bruggen.com/2017/06/podcast-interview-with-sebastien.html[an interview with Sébastien Heymann^], the CEO of https://twitter.com/Linkurious[Linkurious^].

https://twitter.com/rvanbruggen[Rik^] and Sébastien talk about Sébastien's work on https://gephi.org/[Gephi^] and how it contrasts to Linkurious, how Sébastien got into graphs in the first place, and the use cases he sees Neo4j being used for in the future.
