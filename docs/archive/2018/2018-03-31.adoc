////

Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days.
As my colleague Mark Needham is on his well earned vacation, I'm filling in this week.

Next week we plan to do something different. Stay tuned!

=== Interesting, Neo4j Related Projects

* The infamous Max De Marzi demonstrates how to use Neo4j for a common https://maxdemarzi.com/2018/03/23/scheduling-meetings-with-neo4j/[meeting room scheduling task^]. Quite impressive Cypher queries in there.
* Max also demos another new feature of *Neo4j 3.4 - geo-spatial indexes*. In his https://maxdemarzi.com/2018/03/21/neo4j-geospatial-queries/[blog post^], he describes how to use them to find the right type of food place for your tastes via the geolocation of the city that you're both in.
* There seems to be a lot of recent interest in Python front-ends for Neo4j, Timothée Mazzucotelli created https://github.com/Pawamoy/neopy[NeoPy] which is early alpha but contains some nice ideas
* Zeqi Lin has a https://github.com/linzeqipku[number of cool repositories^] of importing different types of data into Neo4j, e.g. Java classes, Git Commits or parts of Docx documents, and even SnowGraph a software data analytics platform built on Neo4j.
// * https://twitter.com/tomasperezv[Tomás Pérez^] created a [Neo4j workshop^] based on your own LinkedIn data, which is really cool.
* I think I came across this before, but the https://github.com/legraphista/newrelic-neo4j[newrelic-neo4j^] is really a neat way of getting Neo4j metrics into NewRelic, thanks https://twitter.com/legraphista[Ștefan-Gabriel Muscalu^]. While browsing his repositories I also came across this https://github.com/findie/wikidata-neo4j-importer[WikiData Neo4j Importer^] which I need to test out
* This https://github.com/weihesdlegend/Auto-complete-System[AutoComplete system^] uses Neo4j which stores terms, counts and other associated information. It returns top 10 suggestions for auto-complete and tracks usage patterns.
* Sam answered a question on counting distinct paths on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49501213/counting-distinct-undirected-paths-in-cypher[StackOverflow^]

.Nigel is teasing us
____
A new version of py2neo is coming soon. Designed for Neo4j 3.x, this will remove the previously mandatory HTTP dependency and include a new set of command line tools and other goodies. Expect an alpha release within the next few days.

=== Graph Visualizations

I had some fun this week with https://github.com/jexp/neo4j-3d-force-graph[3d-force-graph^] and neo4j. It was really easy to combine the 3d graph visualization project based on three.js and available in 2D, 3D, for VR and as React Components with the Neo4j javascript driver. The graphs up to 5000 relationships load sub-second. 

See the results of my experiments in https://github.com/jexp/neo4j-3d-force-graph[my repository^] which also links to several https://rawgit.com/jexp/neo4j-3d-force-graph/master/index.html[live versions^] of different setups (thanks to rawgit)

My colleague Will got an access key to https://twitter.com/graphistry[Graphistry^] and used this https://github.com/johnymontana/pygraphistry/blob/neo4j-example/demos/Neo4jTwitter.ipynb[Jupyter Notebook^] to load the Russian Twitter trolls from Neo4j.

I also came across another https://github.com/corwur/cytoscapeneo4j[Cytoscape plugin for Neo4j^], which looks quite useful.

https://twitter.com/bluejoe2008[Zhihong SHEN^] created a https://github.com/bluejoe2008/grapheco-browser-src[Data Visualizer^] for larger Neo4j graphs using vis.js, you can see an https://bluejoe2008.github.io/gebrowser/examples/example1.html[online demo here^]

=== Desktop & GraphQL

This weeks update of Neo4j Desktop has seen the addition of the neo4j-graphql extension that our team has been working on for a while. 

There will be more detail around it from Will next week but I wanted to share a sneak preview for all of you that want to have some fun with https://neo4j.com/developer/graphql[GraphQL & Neo4j^] over the weekend.
