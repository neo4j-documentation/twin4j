////

Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days.

This week we have the release of Neo4j 3.4 and Neo4j is now available on Google Cloud Launcher. We also have the GQL proposal, a deep dive into the new DateTime data type, and more.

This week’s featured community member is https://twitter.com/nicysneiros[Nicolle Cysneiros^], Full Stack Developer at Labcodes.

Nicolle Cysneiros has been part of the Neo4j community for a couple of years and I first came across her work in a talk from Euro Python 2017 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy611BorGTc[Graph Databases: Talking about your Data Relationships with Python^]. 

In this talk Nicolle gives an introduction to graph databases before showing examples on campaign donation and Game of Thrones datasets. She also shows how to use Neo4j alongside the https://networkx.github.io/[NetworkX^] and http://igraph.org/python/[igraph^] libraries.

Nicolle gave a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8LvW-tyLRc[similar version of the  talk^] at the recent https://us.pycon.org/2018/about/[PyCon 2018^], in Cleveland, Ohio.

On behalf of the Neo4j and Python communities, thanks for all your work Nicolle!

[[neo4j-34-release]]
=== Neo4j 3.4 Released

Following on from the announcement at GraphTour San Francisco a couple of weeks ago, https://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-graph-database-3-4-ga-release/[Neo4j 3.4 was released on Thursday^]. https://twitter.com/ryguyrg?lang=en[Ryan^] explains the highlights in the video below.

youtube::mdNJFTUiuA8[type={type}]

You'll be able to download this version automatically from the Neo4j Desktop and https://neo4j.com/download/other-releases/#releases[packages for server deployments are also available^]. We've also released new versions of the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/[Graph Algorithms^], https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/[APOC^], and https://neo4j.com/developer/graphql/[GraphQL^] plugins. 

I'm excited to finally have geospatial and temporal data types and need to go back and update some of my applications. 
https://twitter.com/adamcowley[Adam Cowley^] has written a great blog post explaining https://www.adamcowley.co.uk/neo4j/temporal-native-dates/[how to use dates^] and we also created a https://neo4j.com/sandbox-v2/[Neo4j 3.4 sandbox^] that has worked examples of both data types.

=== Neo4j available on Google Cloud Launcher

As of this week Neo4j is https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher/details/neo4j-public/neo4j-enterprise-causal-cluster?q=neo4j[available on Google Cloud Launcher^], and Christopher Crosbie from the Google Cloud Partner Engineering Team has https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2018/05/transform-publicly-available-bigquery-data-and-stackdriver-logs-into-graph-databases-with-neo4j[written an article^] in which he shows how Neo4j can be used to better understand NCAA Mascots or analyze your GCP security posture with Stackdriver logs. 

Christopher explains how to take the data from BigQuery into Neo4j and then shows Cypher queries to find the top mascots, as well as commonalities between them. 

He then shows how Neo4j can be used to better understand your full cloud architecture by providing the ability to easily connect data relationships all the way from the Kubernetes microservices that collect the data to the rows in a BigQuery analysis where the data ends up in.

[[gql]]
=== GQL: It’s Time for a Single Property Graph Query Language  

Earlier this week we published the https://gql.today/[GQL Manifesto^], which proposes fusing the best of Cypher, PGQL and G-CORE into a more comprehensive query language built specifically for graph solutions.

If you're in favour of the manifesto https://gql.today/#vote[don't forget to vote^]. 
We'll also be https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/events/250906697/[hosting an online meetup^] on Thursday 24th May 2018 in which there will be a Q&A session where you can get any of your questions answered.

Max does a deep dive into Cypher's https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/functions/predicate/[predicate functions^] and uses some of the new date functions released in Neo4j 3.4

[[online-meetup]]
=== Online Meetup: Experience Report - Building a modern URL shortener

This week on the https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/[Neo4j Online Meetup^] 	https://twitter.com/poeti8[Pouria Ezzati^] presented an experience report on building https://kutt.it/[kutt.it^], a modern URL shortener.

youtube::MUsvRbOnrNY[type={type}]

Pouria explained the origins of the application, how he migrated the backend database from MongoDB to Neo4j, and the modelling decisions he made. He also spent some time going through the NodeJS code that backs the application.

You can find the code for the project in the https://github.com/thedevs-network/kutt[thedevs-network/kutt^] GitHub repository.

This week from the Neo4j Knowledge Base we have an entry that shares a script that https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/an-approach-to-parsing-the-query-log/[parses the query log^] available in the Neo4j Enterprise Edition.

The script summarises the total number of queries, their running time, the date and time of the and last queries, and more.

If you want to understand what's happening on your Neo4j server this is a good place to start.
