=== Searching for Shady Patterns: Shining a light on UK corporate ownership

A few weeks ago I https://markhneedham.com/blog/2018/04/29/pydata-london-2018/[attended^] the https://pydata.org/london2018/schedule/[PyData London 2018^] conference and one of my favourite talks was by https://twitter.com/astroadamh?lang=en[Adam Hill^]. 

Adam gave an experience report of a DataKind UK and Global Witness project where they built the world’s first network graph mapping all of the UK public data on those who control corporate interests in the country


youtube::mWzDXbmvFhQ[type={type}]

It comprises in excess of 4.5 million companies and 4 million individual people as well as 
company officer data and metrics of financial secrecy based upon geographic regions.

Adam explained how Neo4j and the Cypher query language could be used to search for 'shady patterns' which could act as leads for investigative journalists to expose corrupt practices.

I came across https://a16z.com/2018/05/26/journalism-tech-global-icij-panama-papers/[an interesting interview on the a16z Podcast^] with ICIJ director Gerard Ryle in which he explains the role the ICIJ has played in bringing together news organisations from all over the world in the publication of OffShore Leaks, Panama Papers, Paradise Papers, and West Africa Leaks.

In the middle of the interview Gerard goes through the different tools the ICIJ uses to help investigative journalists make sense of data, including Neo4j and graph visualization tool Linkurious.

You can listen to their conversation below or on the https://a16z.com/2018/05/26/journalism-tech-global-icij-panama-papers/[a16z website^].

* Gerrit Meier https://speakerdeck.com/meistermeier/time-to-graph-up-with-spring-data-neo4j[shared the slides^] from his talk at Spring IO in which he explains how to build Spring backed applications using Spring Data Neo4j.

* In https://twitter.com/maxdemarzi[Max De Marzi^]'s http://maxdemarzi.com/2018/05/30/transmuting-documents-into-graphs/[latest blog post^] he shows how to take a document, such as a text file or PDF, use https://tika.apache.org/[Apache Tika^] to detect and extract metadata and text, and finally then run that text through a set of NLP models from OpenNLP to find interesting Entities which are then stored in Neo4j. All the code is available in the https://github.com/maxdemarzi/que_dicen[maxdemarzi/que_dicen^] GitHub repository.

This week we have two new entries in our https://medium.com/neo4j/hands-on-graph-data-visualization-bd1f055a492d[series of posts on Graph Visualization tools^].

https://twitter.com/sbstjn?lang=en[Sebastian Müller^] has https://medium.com/neo4j/neo4j-graph-visualization-like-a-pro-18651963ebd4[written a blog post^] in which he shows how to use https://www.yworks.com/yfileshtml[yWorks^] and Neo4j to create high-quality graph and diagram visualizations for end-user applications.

You can download a https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-for-html/evaluate[free evaluation version of the yFiles for HTML^] software package if you want to try out the tool.

Dan Williams has also https://medium.com/neo4j/hands-on-graph-visualization-keylines-neo4j-9c5aeb7a8d3a[written a post^] in which he  explains how to run a demo using Neo4j and Keylines. The examples uses Cypher queries and KeyLines’ incremental layout to explore a Neo4j dataset of movies and actors.
