This week https://twitter.com/technige?lang=en[Nigel Small^] released http://py2neo.org/v4/[v4 of Py2neo^], a client library and toolkit for working with Neo4j from within Python applications and from the command line. 

This version of the library wraps the 1.6 release of the official Python driver, which means that Py2neo can now focus on higher-level features and proper pythonic API and integrations.

If you're using other tools from the Python ecosystem Py2neo has you covered. The Cursor object now has methods to export to http://www.numpy.org/[numpy^], https://pandas.pydata.org/[pandas^], and http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html[sympy^] objects.
