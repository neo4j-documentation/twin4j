If you've been following TWIN4j you'll almost certainly have heard Bruno mentioned in previous editions - he's one of the most frequent answerer of Neo4j and Cypher questions on StackOverflow.

Every week when I write this blog post I take a look at the http://twin4j.s3.amazonaws.com/twin4j.html[StackOverflow active tab on the Neo4j community graph^], and Bruno is always in the top 3. 

I've learnt some cool things from reading Bruno's answers such as https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45837277/is-it-possible-to-add-a-temporary-property-to-a-neo4j-node-for-return-only/45838433#45838433[how to add a temporary property to a node using map projections^] and just this week https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46168730/finding-mutual-friends-in-a-cypher-statement-starting-with-three-or-more-persons[how to write a query that finds the intersection of multiple starting nodes^].

On behalf of the StackOverflow and Neo4j communities, thanks for all your work Bruno!

=== Online Meetup: Analysing the Kaggle Instacart dataset

In this week's online meetup Jonathan Freeman showed us how to analyse the data from https://twitter.com/kaggle[Kaggle^]'s https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis[Instacart Market Basket Analysis^] competition.  

youtube::V-YDpoMLnTI[type={type}]

Jonathan shows how to import a subset of the dataset using Cypher's http://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/clauses/load-csv/[LOAD CSV^] clause before using the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tutorial/import-tool/[neo4j-import tool^] to load the full dataset. 

He also writes queries to find vegetarians, vegans, and proposes Instafood - an (at the moment) imaginary application that sets people up on dates based on common food preferences!

=== Cypher linter, Cypher on Flink, A Python object oriented interface for Cypher

* https://twitter.com/cleishm[Chris Leishman^] updated  https://github.com/cleishm/libcypher-parser[libcypher-parser^], a parser library and lint tool for Cypher.

* The video of the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ8_v_P1j98&feature=youtu.be[Cypher-based Graph Pattern Matching in Apache Flink^] talk that my colleagues https://twitter.com/kc1s[Martin Junghanns^] and https://twitter.com/darth_max[Max Kießling^] presented at https://flink-forward.org/[Flink Forward^] is now available.

* https://twitter.com/DomWeldon[Dom Weldon^] created https://github.com/DomWeldon/oopycql[oopycql^], an object-oriented interface for managing Cypher queries in Python.

=== Graphoetry: Poetry about graphs

For something different this week we've got https://audioboom.com/posts/6268394-graphoetry[a poem about graph databases^] written by https://audioboom.com/comdotdom[Dom Gittins^].

=== On StackOverflow: MERGE confusion, Subqueries, Shortest path with predicate checks

This week on https://stackoverflow.com/tags/neo4j/[Neo4j StackOverflow^]...

* https://stackoverflow.com/users/92359/inversefalcon[Andrew Bowman^] helps solve some https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46125862/i-cant-create-a-relationship-between-nodes-and-predecessors-by-cypher-while-cre[confusion around the Cypher MERGE clause^].

* https://stackoverflow.com/users/8505125/jonathan-march[Jonathan March^] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46152025/can-this-neo4j-query-be-optimized[optimises a query^] that contains a https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/execution-plans/shortestpath-planning/#_shortest_path_with_additional_predicate_checks_on_the_paths[shortest path search combined with predicate checks^]. 

* https://stackoverflow.com/users/4989460/stdob[stdob--^] explains how to use https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/syntax/expressions/#query-syntax-case[CASE expressions^] to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46226137/running-calculations-against-cypher-subqueries[calculate passion and disdain scores in a social graph^].

=== From The Knowledge Base

This week in the https://neo4j.com/developer/kb[Neo4j Knowledge Base^] Rohan Kharwar shows how to write a Cypher query to https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/query-to-kill-transactions-that-take-longer/[kill transactions that take longer than X seconds and don't contain certain keywords^].

=== Telegram Recipes bot, Chemistry Recommendation Engine, Feature Toggles Graph

* https://github.com/AlexeyKalina[Alexey Kalina^] created  https://github.com/AlexeyKalina/RecipesTelegramBot[RecipesTelegramBot^], a https://telegram.org/Telegram[Telegram^] bot that makes recipe recommendations. 


* Richard J. Hall, Christopher W. Murray, and Marcel L. Verdonk published http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021%2Facs.jmedchem.7b00809[The Fragment Network: A Chemistry Recommendation Engine Built Using a Graph Database^]. The authors run a series of algorithms over Chemical compounds to  generate a graph of 23 million nodes and 107 million relationships explaining the similarity between them.

* Pedro Moreira created https://github.com/the-pet-projects/toggling-it[toggling-it^], an application that lets you create toggles for your applications based on toggle-groups and tags. You can also run "what if" analysis to see the knock on effects of enabling/disabling your toggles.

* I came across https://github.com/NORDUnet/python-norduniclient[python-norduniclient^], a Neo4j database client for https://portal.nordu.net/display/NI/Setting+up+a+NORDUni+3.0+instance[NORDUnet network inventory^]. NORDUni is a project for documenting and presenting physical network infrastructure as well as the logical connections between customers, services and hardware. It stores inventory data models in Neo4j.
