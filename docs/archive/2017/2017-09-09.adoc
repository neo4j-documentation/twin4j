Regina came onto the Neo4j scene earlier this year when she presented at the http://reginaimhoff.com/2017/08/graph-databases-neo4j/[AustinRB^] and http://reginaimhoff.com/2017/03/neo4j-ror/[Austin on Rails^] meetup groups.

This week Regina https://elixirconf.com/speakers/#regina_imhoff[spoke at ElixirConf^], where she showed how to combine Elixir Phoenix with Neo4j to make a clone of a popular social networking site with real time updates to the social graph. You can find the materials from the talk in the https://github.com/StabbyMcDuck/elixir_ravelry[elixir_ravelry^] GitHub repository, and the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWQy7aS_gd8[video^] and https://www.slideshare.net/ReginaImhoff/elixir-neo4j[slides^] from the talk are also available.

On behalf of the Elixir and Neo4j communities, thanks for all your work Regina!

=== Online Meetup: Efficient Graph Algorithms in Neo4j

In this week's online meetup https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael Hunger^] showed us how to use the new Neo4j graph algorithms package that was https://neo4j.com/blog/efficient-graph-algorithms-neo4j/[released at the beginning of August^].

youtube::55uB_t0RKTE[type={type}]

We also had guest appearances by https://github.com/mknblch[Martin Knobloch^] and https://github.com/knutwalker[Paul Horn^] who did all the heavy lifting.

https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz?lang=en[Tomaz Bratanic^], who wrote most of the documentation for the graph algorithms project, also has a couple of blog posts showing how to use them:

* https://tbgraph.wordpress.com/2017/08/31/neo4j-london-tube-system-analysis/[Neo4j London tube system analysis^], in which he finds the shortest weighted path between different stations and works out which stations are the most important in the network.

* https://tbgraph.wordpress.com/2017/09/05/neo4j-facebook-ego-network-analysis/[Neo4j Facebook ego network analysis^], in which he shows how to use the triangle count and betweenness centrality algorithms on an undirected graph.

You can download the algorithms from the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/releases[neo4j-graph-algorithms^] GitHub repository.

=== New to graph databases?

If you're new to graph databases and Neo4j, this is a good week for you, the community has been busy creating content for you to consume.

Vindya Hettige wrote http://mitrai.com/tech-guide/an-insight-to-working-with-neo4j-graph-databases/[An Insight to working with Neo4j Graph Databases^], a very thorough tutorial which compares relational and graph databases, before showing how to get up and running with Neo4j on a variety of operating systems. Vindya then goes on to give an introduction to the Cypher query language, covering the main clauses and data types available.

https://twitter.com/benzvan[Ben Zvan^] presented https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul6gTcoKzB8[WTF is a graph database?^] at the https://www.meetup.com/preview/DevOps-Minneapolis/events/242124032[DevOps Minneapolis meetup^].

And finally, this week Neo4j featured in https://twitter.com/JulieTorero[Julia Torres^] and https://twitter.com/kiaaaana[Kiana T^]'s https://twitter.com/crush_code[Code Crush podcast^] this week. In the https://codecrush.simplecast.fm/episodes/4e99bafb/everyone-s-a-node-with-neo4j[Everyone's A Node With Neo4J!^] episode, Julia and Kiana talk about the https://neo4j.com/sandbox-v2/[TrumpWorld sandbox^], https://neo4j.com/developer/language-guides/[language drivers^], https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-create-neo4j-browser-guide/[browser guides^], and more.

=== Discovering Awesome Female Engineers in the GraphQL Community

Late last week https://twitter.com/peggyrayzis[Peggy Rayvis^] tweeted that she was trying to find ladies in the GraphQL community so that she could follow them on Twitter:

tweet::902651646483861511[type={type}]

In response, Michael Hunger wrote https://medium.com/@mesirii/discovering-awesome-female-engineers-in-the-graphql-community-88ddf45e4ce1[a blog post^] in which he shows how to use https://gender-api.com/[gender-api.com^] in combination with the GraphQL community graph to find those people. The GraphQL community graph is a Neo4j database that we populate hourly with data from Twitter, GitHub, Meetup, and StackOverflow. 

If you'd like to explore the GraphQL community graph you can find it at https://graphql.communitygraph.org/[graphql.communitygraph.org^]. You can also see a http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/twigraphql/twigraphql.html[summary page of what's happened this week in GraphQL^].

If you'd like to create a community graph for your community we'd love to help - send us an email devrel@neo4j.com. 

=== CityGML change detection, Dependency Analysis, California Road Networks

* https://github.com/evagian[Eva Giannatou^] wrote a report https://github.com/evagian/California-road-network-NEO4J-CYPHER-graph-and-queries/blob/master/neo4j_report_done.pdf[Graph data mining with Neo4j (PDF)^] in which she shows how to import a dataset containing  California’s road networks and points of interest and then write Cypher queries against it. The source code for the project is also https://github.com/evagian/California-road-network-NEO4J-CYPHER-graph-and-queries[available on GitHub^].

* A really cool project I came across is https://github.com/tum-gis/citygml-change-detection[citygml-change-detection^] by http://www.gis.bgu.tum.de/en/our-team/staff/son-nguyen/[Son Nguyen^] from the https://github.com/tum-gis[Department of Civil, Geo and Environmental Engineering at Technical University of Munich^]. This tool can be used to detect spatio-semantic changes between two arbitrarily large-sized CityGML datasets using Neo4j.

* https://twitter.com/feststelltaste[Markus Harrer^] shows how to do https://www.feststelltaste.de/java-type-dependency-analysis/[Java Type Dependency Analysis^] by combining jQAssistant, Cypher, and d3.js. 

* https://twitter.com/haraldpehl[Harald Pehl^] created https://github.com/hal/model-graph[model-graph^], a tool for analysing the https://twitter.com/WildFlyAS[WildFlyAS^] (formerly known as JBossAS) management model

=== On the podcast: Kevin Madden, Tom Sawyer Software

This week on the podcast https://twitter.com/rvanbruggen[Rik^] spoke to Kevin Madden, Chief Software Engineer of https://twitter.com/TSawyerSoftware[Tom Sawyer Software^].

They talk about Kevin's history with graphs, from the early 90's where he built network visualization platforms for the early days of the networking systems to 2017 and the https://www.tomsawyer.com/products/perspectives/[Tom Sawyer Perspectives product^]. 

Kevin also discusses the adoption and use of graph visualisation in high-end engineering such as airline and auto manufacturing.  

If you've any interest in graph visualisation at all this you're going to enjoy this one.
